What is Sphinx ?
================

Sphinx is the rising tool in the Python community to build
documentation. See http://sphinx.pocoo.org.

It is now used for instance by Python. See http://docs.python.org/dev and many
others 

Sphinx uses reStructuredText, and can be used to write your buildout-based
application. This recipe sets everything up for you, so you can
provide a nice-looking documentation within your buildout, in static html
or even PDF.

The fact that your documentation is managed like your code
makes it easy to maintain and change it.
