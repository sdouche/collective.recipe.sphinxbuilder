What is Sphinx?
===============

Sphinx is the mainly tool in the Python community to build documentation. See
http://sphinx.pocoo.org.

It is now used for instance by Python. See http://docs.python.org and many
others 

Sphinx uses reStructuredText, and can be used to write your buildout-based
application. This recipe sets everything up for you, so you can provide a
nice-looking documentation within your buildout, in static html, PDF or even
epub.

The fact that your documentation is managed like your code makes it easy to
maintain and change it.
